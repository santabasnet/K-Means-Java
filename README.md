# K-Means-Java
K-Means Demo from Scratch in Java, implemented during undergraduate lecture. 

A centroid based implementation of K-Means clustering algorithm, which utilizes 
iterative process to keep finding new centroids. This demonstrates the working
of unsupervised clustering algorithm in Machine Learning.
